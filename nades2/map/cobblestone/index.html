            </svg><p>Hi r/GlobalOffensive!<br>
I would like to tell how CS:GO changed my life.<br>
I am 21 years old and from Turkey. I have always been a computer guy spends all day on pc but never played anything online or competitive, until August 2013.<br>
I bought the CS:GO when it was out of beta, but never played the competitive mode. I just played 2-3 matches of Arms Race then went back to other stuff.<br>
Then in the summer of 2013 my friends talked about competitive and invited me to one. After 10 wins my rank was Silver 3 (hehe) and like other silvers I always bought the p90 and sprayed all day long. It was just like another game for me. Nothing special.<br>
After a couple of months they started to talk about "Dreamhack". At first I thought it was some kind of hack (don't laugh!). Then they told me about it and I should watch.<br>
First game I have ever watched was NiP's match. I was stunned by their aim and teamplay. They were unbeatable back then. That was the moment I decided to give my all to be like them or even a little close. It has been 2000+ hours and I have reached Global Elite with my friends. But I am back to SMFC because of.. you know CHEATERS.<br>
Anyways, in the very beginning of 2014 I said "I should go to Dreamhack Summer watch them and feel all the hype!". After 3000 kilometers We have reached to Elmia. I put my laptop to my desk and started to look for the place where CS:GO matches took place. As I was walking, someone screamed "FITTA"! It was Friberg's voice I lol'd and found where the place is. It was a wonderful feeling to see them playing 1 meter away from me. My goal was to get signature from all NiP players but I only got Photos ,It was enough for me though:D. When I was back from Sweden I was in love with the country and the Swedes. They were the nicest people I have ever met and even a small city like Jönköping had fantastic scenery.<br>
I am studying Industrial Design here in Turkey, I have given a lot of thought I decided to go to Umeå University for Master's Degree and really want to live there after I graduate.<br>
I know the post is long but I wanted the share my story with people who shares the same CS:GO passion with me. If one person upvotes I will be really happy.<br>
