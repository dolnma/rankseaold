                CPU/GPU Combination Your CPU (Processor) and your Graphics Card (GPU) will almost entirely determine how many frames per second you are getting in game. Thankfully for us, Counter-Strike GO is a very low graphic-intense game unlike other titles such as Crysis 3, so achieving a constant 150+ Frames per Second isn't as costly. First things first, to check your Frames-per-second (FPS), use your tilda key ` to access your console in-game. Type "net_graph 1" without quotations to display your choke/loss and frames per second. If your FPS ever drops below 145 (using a 144hz monitor) during gameplay, you will experience terrible screen lag which obviously puts you at a huge disadvantage in game. -The Processors Intel vs AMD. Intel makes better higher-end equipment. AMD is generally, but not always, more favorable to those on a lower budget. Price per performance generally favors AMD on the low end, but Intel on the mid-to-high end. If you are building or purchasing a computer, these are the two minimums I would recommend. They will be slightly overkill for CSGO, but going any less will undoubtedly leave you frustrated in a years time when software requirements start catching up with your benchmarks. -Intel I wouldn't go lower than an i5 processor if you decide to go with intel. The i5 CPU's will range generally between $189 and $249. The models you want to look for are models with the letter "K" after the number. This indicates that the processor can be unlocked and overclocked to higher speeds in order to get more power and performance out of the CPU. Since Counter-Strike is more CPU dependent than it is GPU, this is very desirable and will give you the best Price-per-Performance ratio. Just remember that you'll want a z87/z97 motherboard to go along with your unlocked CPU to be able to overclock it towards it's limits. i5-4690k i5-3570k i5-4670k Note that the first number following the CPU (in this case i5-4XXX) indicates which generation processor it is. For example an i5-4XXX indicates a 4th generation processor whereas an i5-3XXX indicates a 3rd generation processor. As a general rule of thumb, you'll see about a 10% performance increase for each generation step. -AMD AMD is a great alternative for people who don't want to break their budget of $200 for a CPU. AMD has a few options, but for best Price-per-Performance, we'll look at a couple models in their FX-series: FX-8350 FX-6300 The first number after the FX indicates how many cores the processor has. So the FX-8350 would indicate that it's an 8 core CPU, whereas the FX-6300 indicates a 6 core CPU. The FX-8350 is a fantastic CPU, and I would NOT recommend dropping any lower than the FX-8300 series unless you are completely broke. The FX-6300 series will get you adequate FPS on Counter-Strike when paired with a decent GPU, but you'll find your computer obsolete long before a FX-8300 build will be. If you do some research you will find the FX-9590 as well. Do not ever, under any circumstances, purchase this. It is literally a FX-8350 overclocked out of the box, and you're doing nothing more than donating a hundred dollars to AMD.<br>
If you want to compare CPU's, you can look up the benchmarks for any CPU at https://www.cpubenchmark.net/[1] The models I've listed are among the top of what I would recommend as entry level gaming CPUs.<br>
-The Graphics Cards Graphics cards are currently in two categories, Nvidia cards and AMD cards. I've used many cards, and have found the most success with these brands: Asus, EVGA, and MSI. It's worth noting that Gigabyte has also started to produce success over the last year. You will only need more than 2 GB of video ram if you are gaming at a resolution higher than 1920x1200 (gaming across multiple monitors or 4k monitors). If you're looking to buy a GPU, narrow your brands down to the ones I've just listed. -Nvidia Nvidia cards are broken up into two categories: GT and GTX. You're going to want a GTX card, which basically indicates it's a gaming-grade GPU. -AMD AMD cards were less favorable until about a year ago when the R7 and R9 series line was released. You can lookup the benchmarks for these cards, but when paired with at least an FX-8300 series or i5 CPU, you will not have any issues maintaining 150 FPS. (low end ~150+ fps, mid ~225+ fps, high ~330 fps+) GTX-650 (low end) GTX-660 (low end GTX-750 (low end) GTX-760 (mid) GTX-770 (high) GTX-780 (high) GTX-970 (high) GTX-980 (ultra high) R7-260 (low) R7-260X (low) R9-270 (mid) R9-280 (mid) R9-270X (mid-to-high) R9-290 (high) R9-280X (high) R9-290X (ultra high) As far as SLI/Crossfire is concerned, you always can, but just remember that one good card is always better than 2 decent cards. Buy a nice card and then SLI it as needed in the future, when game demands are higher and the price of an identical GPU is lower.
