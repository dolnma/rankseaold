submitted 1 year ago by Penence<br>
So I am currently on an ASUS VE248, which has 60 hz. So I saw that a 60 hz monitor can only show 60 fps, which is not the optimum, because I reach between 120 to 160 fps. It seems like 120 hz monitors are really pricey, so I wanted to make sure, if its really worth the buy, and what monitors you guys have and what you would recommend. I hope you can help me to make the decision whether to buy a 120 hz monitor or stay at my 60 hz one.<br>

Once you go 120/144hz you never go back<br>
permalinksavegive gold<br>
[–]loloTRICKEDu 3 points 1 year ago <br>
The difference is huge. I got a new ASUS 144 month or so ago and I went to play on a friends 60hz monitor when we LANed and the difference was very noticeable. I highly recommend getting the 120hz+.<br>

[–]EddCSGO Legendary Eagle 1 point 1 year ago <br>
Does it improve your game? :o<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]loloTRICKEDu 7 points 1 year ago <br>
In a feeling sense, I would say yes. CS is a fast paced game and you have to constantly check angles. When you swipe quickly with a 144hz monitor, there is no motion blur so you're able to see more clearly.<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]americigerm Natus Vincere Fan 2 points 1 year ago <br>
There is still motion blur at 144hz. Lightboost 120hz has no motion blur and is waaay way better.<br>

When I went back to 60Hz from 120Hz because my old monitor died, I couldn't play CSGO for more than 1 hour before my eyes started to hurt. Yes you should buy one - right now actually.<br>

[–]alphastormgr Ninjas in Pyjamas Fan 2 points 1 year ago <br>
it improves the "feeling" therefore it improves your skill indirectly ...<br>
you will get better with 120+hz monitor<br>

Non 120/144 owner here... Seems like it would be like when I got my mechanical keyboard. Basically turned me into a keyboard snob<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]sno2787 The Global Elite 1 point 1 year ago <br>
I mean there's a distinct advantage on a 120hz but that doesn't mean you can't frag hard on a 60hz. 120+ is better but not 100% necessary. At LANs they'll prolly rock 120 or 140 hz monitors so if u plan on playing competitively then getting used to one isn't a bad idea. If ur casual don't worry about it unless u got some cash to blow in which case I can point you in the right direction :)<br>

I was concerned about what inputs I'd need for all my hardware to operate properly with the 144hz/120hz monitors. I have a GeForce GTX 550 ti. Would I need a DVI-I port? Or an HDMI port?<br>
Intel Core i5-2500 3.3 GHz Processor/ Corsair XMS3 (2 x 4GB) RAM/ GeForce GTX 550 ti/ Windows 7<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]sno2787 The Global Elite 1 point 1 year ago* <br>
You need dual link dvi or the hdmi1.3 most likely.<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]furrogate Gold Nova Master 1 point 1 year ago <br>
ok. looks like my gpu has hdmi 3.<br>
"HDMI3 Yes"<br>
If I only had the two dvi inputs on my gpu would the dual link dvi make dual monitors impossible w/o a second graphics card?<br>

[–]tasetase Master Guardian II 1 point 1 year ago <br>
What brand/model do you suggest, in like the 23" range? I don't have tons of money but I game a ton, and the blur is noticable.<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]sno2787 The Global Elite 1 point 1 year ago <br>
BENQ is the best way to go. You kind of have to spend some cash if you want a good 120 or 144 hz monitor... Personally, i love the benq xl2420t. You're really not going to find a cheap one but check out BENQ and ASUS<br>

I kept my CRT monitor up until a few months ago when I bought the Asus 144hz monitor. I had even tried older Acer 120hz monitors and they had too much ghosting / input lag for me. Maybe some people aren't as sensitive, but I can never game seriously on a 60hz or even a bad 120hz monitor.<br>

[–]tasetase Master Guardian II 1 point 1 year ago <br>

[–]Lucky_Kvack /r/GlobalOffensive Moderator 3 points 1 year ago <br>
Simply put.<br>
If you are at the same skill level of your opponent but they have better hardware, you will lose games simply because of it. It might be one in a thousand but when you get towards the higher levels every little thing matters.<br>

I'm eagle 2 and I have ~45fps. So no you don't need it, but from what I hear it's a lot more enjoyable if you have 120hz.<br>

I play with 20, and for me its playable, bu from experience.It can be hard to aim right with the chopping going on but fine otherwards<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]Sidewhynder Silver I -1 points 1 year ago <br>
60 fps MINIMUM for any multiplayer game. if you have a higher hz monitor then make that as your minimum. I have no idea how people play cs without having constant 60 fps minimum even when there are like 5 smokes on the ground.<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]parasemic Silver I 2 points 1 year ago <br>
Yes. It's brilliant. Got myself BenQ XL2411t today and it made immediate impact on my playing and headshot ratio. Peeking corners became so much easier and more enjoyable when you see the enemy much sooner. Difference is so huge that in situation where I'd have to prefire before, I can do with just preaim and shoot if need be.<br>

i went for 120 Hz without lightboost or such:<br>
ITS AMAZING.<br>
Me personally (and a friend either) even see/feel it at normal using of windows, browsing.<br>
i got mine for 120€<br>
no you dont need it but it feels amazing and you can get it cheap<br>

you would play better on 120hz and its a discussion thats been had a million times<br>
theres a number of great advantages to 120hz OP yes you should buy one and people need to stop re-asking this question its getting annoying<br>

So which 120 hz monitor is good but don't have the highest price. I see people recommending a BenQ, but thats very expensive.<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]Dubz4kx 2 points 1 year ago <br>
I feel like it depends on how far you want to take your gaming. It's not really that much money if you play 3-4 hours a day. But if you just want to play very casual I could see why you wouldn't want to throw that much money on it. But if you already have a good graphics card I would certainly recommend playing with a good monitor, not only for CSGO.<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]esmo88 Counter Logic Gaming Fan 2 points 1 year ago <br>
The Asus 144hz is far cheaper than the BenQ 120hz. It also boasts a 1ms faster response time than the BenQ XL2420T.<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–][deleted] 5 points 1 year ago <br>
Shouldn't you be comparing it to the XL2411T, which is BenQs 144Hz monitor, and is priced around the same as the Asus monitor.<br>
permalinksaveparent<br>
[–]esmo88 Counter Logic Gaming Fan 3 points 1 year ago* <br>
You're right. I should be comparing those two instead. However, you're wrong on the price I think. The BenQ is $60usd more on Newegg.com<br>
EDIT: The Asus is $90usd cheaper on Amazon currently. Just added it to my shopping cart ;)<br>

That's the 27". 24" is pretty standard for gaming I think.<br>

Not really.. plus going above 23-24" at 1080p really starts to look a bit ugly.<br>

It has nothing to do with that. 27" monitors are usually higher than 1920x1080 to keep the pixel size the same. The reason people don't use 27" much for gaming is because with screens that large, you get in situations where you actually have to turn your head a bit to comfortably see some things. I know I sound stupid, but it's true. 27" is too much to take in at that close of a range.<br>

I think its easier to take the awp dust2 mid shot on a 120hz monitor, i hope i will get 1 on black friday<br>

[–]SolobeN 2 points 1 year ago <br>
it is, everythings easier due to you seeing more frames faster and also having less input leg<br>
also spinning around is less blurry<br>

I still dont know why you got downvotet there, you were right you play better on 120hz due to you seing more frames<br>

[–]esmo88 Counter Logic Gaming Fan -2 points 1 year ago* <br>
If you've never played on 120/144 then you really have no right to assume this.<br>
EDIT: lol downvoted?<br>

Get a QNIX and get both!<br>

[–]LittleKobald 1 point 1 year ago <br>
Why not both? My qn2710 is one of the best purchases I've made.<br>

[–]ohmk Gold Nova III 1 point 1 year ago <br>
can i use my radeon 4870 with this or will i have to upgrade my gpu?<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]LittleKobald 1 point 1 year ago <br>
I don't know if that will run it. I get about 220fps average, but I'm running with two 7970s.<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]ohmk Gold Nova III 1 point 1 year ago <br>
Yeah I'm fine with not pushing 120hz and upgrading my gpu eventually, but I'd like to know if the card is even compatible with the monitor.<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]LittleKobald 1 point 1 year ago <br>
Yes it is.<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]ohmk Gold Nova III 1 point 1 year ago <br>
Are you certain? I really want to buy one...I think my gpu supports dvi-d but i'm not sure<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]LittleKobald 1 point 1 year ago <br>
Yes it does. I didn't see a single manufacturer that didn't include dvi.<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]sMurf4r 1 point 1 year ago <br>
it needs to be dual-link dvi but I think 4870 is<br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]parasemic Silver I 1 point 1 year ago <br>
uhm, you need DVI-D dual link for +120hz. http://www.hisdigital.com/UserFiles/news/200902261616114965.png <br>
permalinksaveparentgive gold<br>
[–]LittleKobald 1 point 1 year ago <br>
I know what that is. You know most graphics cards, if they support dvi, support ddvi right? Check it out, it's supported.<br>

I have one aswell, pushed to 120 but I wouldn't recommend it for gamers. The motion blur is very noticeable. Get a lightboost one if motion blur will be a problem for you.<br>

What is the overall consensus on the best overall monitor, the best value, most overpriced etc?<br>
I am interested in picking one of these up, but I don't know a ton about monitors.<br>

[–]Xathian Master Guardian Elite 1 point 1 year ago <br>
need ? no but it's nice, apparently im sitting on 60 planning on going 120+ and 1440p soon but need to shop around<br>
permalinksavegive gold<br>
[–]hab1bb Legendary Eagle Master 1 point 1 year ago <br>
make sure your GPU supports it<br>

How can I find out if it does.<br>

I moved from a shitty 60hz TV to a BenQ 144hz monitor and the difference is huge.<br>

Go to the store -> Buy it -> Install it -> Enjoy.<br>

my old 60hz finally shit the bed, went with asus's 24" 144hz and definitely recommend 120hz<br>

[–]MrDivi95 Supreme Master First Class 1 point 1 year ago <br>
You dont need it. you can still obtain a high skill level on an old monitor. But you will have an edge and well, it is certainly worth the money, if you can afford it.<br>

If you face a player with equal skill level, reaction time, latency, etc. and he has a 120hz, he would win.<br>
permalinksavegive gold<br>
[–]SpleWge Master Guardian I -2 points 1 year ago <br>
. plain and simple: 120 is more than 60 so that MUST mean its twice as good! (7 ate 9)<br>
