# CSGORankMeWeb
Web interface for Rank Me CSGO Stat tracking plugin

# Purpose
This web interface is to allow users to view the stats from Counter Strike Global Offensive servers running the RankMe plugin found <a href='https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1456869'>Here</a>

# Features
<ul>
<li>Sort by various stats, kills, time, headshots, points or any other tracked stat.</li>
<li>Check your personal stats from any of the servers running RankMe</li>
<li>Check stats of any player you desire that plays on the server(s) you are looking for.</li>
</ul>

# Restrictions

The main restriction as of now is that there is only support for mySQL and not sqlite. I will possibly start development of a seperate project for converting sqlite to mySQL so that people can go down that road if they wish. I may also work on implementing support for sqlite into the current project, stay tuned!
